<p style="font-family: 'Cabin', sans-serif;color:White">Computer science and technology is a rapidly emerging field but that is not what made interested in exploring in this field.when I learn a new programming language for the first time or even when I log into Facebook every day and come up with some new feature, what I feel is a sense of marvel. Hours and hours of my time that I spend in front of my computer every day does not make me bored. My interest in the subject has grown with each passing year. In the very beginning of my undergraduate program under my course, I had to learn c programming language that was the start of my interest in the field of computer science and technology. I felt myself in comfort and excitement while pursuing the class of programming. I could clearly see the rapid improvement in myself and I felt a similar sense of exhilaration when I saw my code run successfully.It is this feeling, which till date, drives me to not give up on even the toughest of problems. And it is this love for programming, combined with my desire to dig deeper into the working of various applications and technologies which propel me to apply for Infy campus champs. I try my best to foresee what the future is going to be, and what I need to do in order to succeed in that future. I not only have a vision but I complement it with planning and hard work. <br><br>My friends say that I am an extrovert, good planner and creative in my activities and I also have a never-give-up attitude which helps me to achieve my goals invariably. I work hard and sincerely to achieve good grades, which is very evident from my consistent grades. At the same time I am not a student who concentrates on studies alone. Apart from having academic proficiency, I have participated actively in many extra-curricular activities like cultural, social service events and sports. I love to dance, and I won many awards in debate in my school days and a award in District Level Speech competition in my undergraduate education. Maintaining a right balance between academics and extra-curricular activities, I am actively involve in attending seminars and watching lectures on youtube.</p>
